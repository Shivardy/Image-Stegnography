    <h3>How Image Stegnography Works?</h3>
    <p>
      Given an image, the image is broken down to pixel and each pixel have 3
      data values (RGB), each RGB value contains 8-bits
    </p>
    <img
      src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/rbg.png') }}"
      class="img-fluid"
    />
    <p>
      The leftmost bit is the most significant bit. If we change the leftmost
      bit it will have a large impact on the final value. For example, if we
      change the leftmost bit from 1 to 0 (11111111 to 01111111) it will change
      the decimal value from 255 to 127. But the rightmost bit is the less
      significant bit. If we change the rightmost bit it will have less impact
      on the final value. For example, if we change the leftmost bit from 1 to 0
      (11111111 to 11111110) it will change the decimal value from 255 to 254.
    </p>
    <img
      src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/binary.png') }}"
      class="img-fluid"
    />
    <p>
      So In the encryption function we convert the input message to binary
      format and start looping through all the pixel and whenever we find a
      position that can hold one bit we try to embed that bit and insert extra
      bit’s to in some pattern examples (fifteen 1’s followed by 0) so whenever
      we try to decrypt we pick the bit which is followed by our pattern.
